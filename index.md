## Hey there, welcome to my page 🙋‍♂️
  
I am currently an ML Engineer at Interset (a MicroFocus company) and contribute to ML Ops and build data pipelines to make SaaS products which derive insights from data. I have worked the most with User Behaviour Analytics data in ecommerce and cybersecurity domains.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/singhsatnam/singhsatnam.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/singhsatnam/singhsatnam.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
